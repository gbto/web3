# SUMMARY

This module contains utils for extracting and displaying data from smart contracts deployed on ethereum compatible networks such as BscChain, Polygon, Celo...
We can collect for any contract all the transactions made with this contract by external users, as well as the detailed event logs of the smart contract executions.
By extracting this data, we can then modelize this data in a way that'll help identify users profiles, understand patterns and detect communities clusters.
