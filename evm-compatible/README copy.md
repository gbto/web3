# Blockchain repository

A repository that contains blockchain related experimentations. It contains code to connect to different networks and collect validation and rewards data, contract transactions and events logs, or the code for smart contracts.

# 1. EVM compatible:

We can use the module evm-compatible for collecting and decoding smart contracts transactions and events logs. For finding addresses of trendy smart contract on the ethereum blockchain, you can visit:
- [Analytics](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#analytics)
- [DAO platforms](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#ethereum-based-dao-platforms)
- [Decentralized exchanges](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#decentralized-exchanges-on-ethereum)
- [DeFi infrastructure and Dev tooling](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#defi-infrastructure--dev-tooling)
- [Marketplaces](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#marketplaces)
- [Prediction markets](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#prediction-markets)
- [Yield aggregators](https://defiprime.com/ethereum#yield-aggregators-on-ethereum)

# 2. Solana:

We can use the solana-staking module to retrieve information about the validatio,n process implemented on the Solana network, i.e. information about validators, the corresponding delegators, validators rewards history, delegators staking history and so on.
In the solana-dapp module, you can find examples of rust smart contracts deployed on the Solana network.

# 3. Cosmos:

This module includes code that can be used to retrieve information from the Cosmos ecosystem.
